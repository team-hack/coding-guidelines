# Coding Guidelines

Visit [Getting Started](gettingstarted.md) to get started with our community.

Be sure to also check out the below, as it's important that you understand the following about our group culture before you join us.

## Our Code Is Open Source

Whatever we code is for the benefit of the open source community. We generally follow the [GNU LICENSE v3 Standard](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), so please be sure to familiarize yourself with it first and foremost. You may use the code for your own projects, however you may not redistribute, plagiarize our projects as your own commercial projects for sale (in basic terms -- again read the full LICENSE for each project).

## Be Ethical. Do Not Do Harm To Others.

Please think before you code. Do not code or partake in coding that would bring harm to other individuals. Though our name is "Team Hack", we think of "hacking" in the ethical way; meaning we want to create and modify projects for means of betterment of society. We do not mean "hacking" in the term of harming someone else's life, assets, computers, etc.

## Abide By Code of Conduct

Full code of conduct available at [JavaScriptLA/Code-of-Conduct](https://javascriptla.net/code-of-conduct/). In basic terms, we wish for this community to be **inclusive**, meaning anyone can code -- regardless of gender, race, sexual preference, religion, political stance. You may not troll/harrass/instigate our team members; doing so will result in your removal from this group. We want our team to be **safe** for all its members.

If you feel unsafe, threatened, harrassed by any other teammate within our team, please contact the admins of Team Hack directly via admin@teamhack.org. We do not tolerate abusive behavior of any kind and will be swift in our action to help those in need of support.

Here are also some [social rules](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules) we should all try to embrace.

## No One is Perfect, Step Up And Mentor

Do not insult, put down or otherwise demoralize others for code quality. Help them instead to become a better coder. No matter how great you are at coding now, someone else taught you as a beginner. If you feel like someone else's code is not that great, help them so they can write better.

That said, you do not have to be someone's personal teacher. We are not here to help people learn how to code; that is the responsibility of the individual member. But we can mentor, so if you are able to share a resource or learning aid, or even spare a few minutes of your time to go over how to do something a bit better -- that would be greatly appreciated.
